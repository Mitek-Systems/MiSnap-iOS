/**
 @method didReceiveSampleBuffer:
 @abstract
 Called whenever a MiSnapCamera instance outputs a new video frame.
 
 @param sampleBuffer
 A CMSampleBuffer object containing the video frame data and additional information about the frame, such as its format and presentation time.
 
 @discussion
 Delegates receive this message whenever the output captures and outputs a new video frame, decoding or re-encoding it as specified by its videoSettings property. Delegates can use the provided video frame in conjunction with other APIs for further processing. This method is called periodically, so it must be efficient to prevent capture performance problems, including dropped frames.
 
     Clients that need to reference the CMSampleBuffer object outside of the scope of this method must CFRetain it and then CFRelease it when they are finished with it.
 
 Note that to maintain optimal performance, some sample buffers directly reference pools of memory that may need to be reused by the device system and other capture inputs. This is frequently the case for uncompressed device native capture where memory blocks are copied as little as possible. If multiple sample buffers reference such pools of memory for too long, inputs will no longer be able to copy new samples into memory and those samples will be dropped. If your application is causing samples to be dropped by retaining the provided CMSampleBuffer objects for too long, but it needs access to the sample data for a long period of time, consider copying the data into a new buffer and then calling CFRelease on the sample buffer if it was previously retained so that the memory it references can be reused.
